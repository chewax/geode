# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-03)

**Core value:** Non-destructive editing — nothing is ever lost and the git plumbing stays invisible to non-technical users.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — sidebar-sections

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (sidebar-sections) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-04 -- Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Capa 0 "go back" = soft linear restore (new primitive, distinct from checkout/detached-HEAD) — foundational to Phase 2.
- Timeline is repo-level, not per-note; replaces the current per-note TimelineScrubber and is always available.
- Save asks for a human name; AI writes the description (Phase 3).
- Auto-snapshots configurable + only when changed + no AI; racy-git-safe via existing content-hash detection (Phase 4).
- Git stays hidden (not removed) behind an Advanced Mode toggle (Phase 5).
- [Phase ?]: SidebarSection usa display:none al colapsar para conservar el estado interno de FileTree

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Racy-git landmine: change detection must hash real content vs HEAD blobs — never revert to statusMatrix (affects Phases 2 and 4).
- Force checkouts overwrite the working dir; the soft-restore primitive (Phase 2) must NOT use force checkout / detached-HEAD.
- App.tsx is a 47KB monolith with 40+ state vars — the sidebar (Phase 1) and time-travel (Phase 2) refactors touch it heavily.
- Zero automated test coverage; git operations are untested — high risk for the new restore/snapshot primitives.
